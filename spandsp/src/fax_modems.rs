//! FAX modem layer.
//!
//! This module is a placeholder. The FAX modem layer sits between the T.30
//! protocol engine and the audio transport and manages the various modem
//! types (V.17, V.27ter, V.29, V.21). A full wrapper would require
//! significant effort and is left for future work.

/// Placeholder for FAX modem state.
